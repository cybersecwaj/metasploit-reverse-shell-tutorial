# Metasploit Reverse Shell Tutorial

Welcome to the Metasploit Reverse Shell Tutorial! This tutorial is designed to help you understand how to create and use a reverse shell payload using Metasploit, a popular penetration testing framework.

## What is a Reverse Shell?

A reverse shell is a type of shell where the target machine initiates the connection to the attacker's machine. This allows the attacker to gain shell access to the target system, enabling them to execute commands remotely.

## Prerequisites

- Metasploit Framework
- Kali Linux or any other Linux distribution with Metasploit installed
- Basic knowledge of command-line interface (CLI) and networking concepts

## Usage

1. **Generate Payload:** Use Metasploit to generate a reverse shell payload. You can customise the payload according to your requirements, such as the target platform and listening IP/port.
   
2. **Set Up Listener:** Start a listener on your machine to receive the incoming connection from the target. Make sure to specify the same IP and port as used in the payload.

3. **Execute Payload:** Execute the generated payload on the target system. Once executed, the target machine will establish a connection to your listener, providing you with a shell session.

4. **Explore and Control:** Once the connection is established, you'll have shell access to the target system. You can now execute commands, transfer files, or perform various tasks as per your requirement.
